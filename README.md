# ✈️ Airline Delay Analysis (SQL Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes flight delay data using SQL to uncover insights about:
- Causes of flight delays (Carrier, Weather, NAS, Security, Late Aircraft)
- Airline and airport performance
- Monthly and seasonal delay trends
- Flight cancellations and diversions
- On-time performance of airlines

## 🛠️ Key Steps
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed NULLs, standardized carrier names, replaced missing delays with 0.
- **Exploratory Queries**: Flights per carrier, airport, year, and month.
- **Business Analysis**: Delay causes, performance metrics, cancellation/diversion rates.

## 📊 Insights
- Identified the largest contributors to delays.
- Compared airlines and airports by delay percentage.
- Tracked delay patterns across months and seasons.
- Ranked airlines by on-time performance.

## 🚀 Tools Used
- **SQL (MySQL Workbench)**
- Dataset: `airline_delay`
